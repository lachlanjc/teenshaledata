Teen Shale Data
===============

A simple Sinatra app for the [Teen Shale Network](https://twitter.com/TeenShaleNet16) to crunch stream data. It accepts a TSV file upload of data, then computes an average for each measurement for each day (usually ~96 records/day, with 2 measurements, but that fluctuates) and exports a CSV for download.

Example input/export data is in the `/examples` directory (real data!).
